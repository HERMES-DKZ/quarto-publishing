Quarto can be used through a variety of Coding environments, such as Visual Studio Code, RStudio or a simple Plaintext editor. In this Lesson we will focus on the use of Visual Studio Code, but many if not most functionalities will be similar or identical in other environments.

## Software Setup

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: prereq

As we are working in the Visual Studio Code environment, the only step needed to start working with Quarto is the installation and activation of the Quarto extension in VSCode. To do so you need to open the Extension tab in VS Code (Crtl+Shift+X on Windows) and search for Quarto. Now you only need to press “install” in order to activate Quarto in your VSCode.
